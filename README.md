# Predicting Corn Prices
A study on predicting corn future prices based on weather and other commodity data. 

Created as the term project for [ECON 323: Quantitative Economic Modelling](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=ECON&course=323). The final deliverable is located in [`src/final_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/PrayusShrestha/crop-price-prediction/blob/master/src/final_project.ipynb). The data used is stored as CSV files under the `data/` directory. These were scraped from commodity and financial data APIs; code for this is in  [`src/data_scraper.ipynb`](https://github.com/PrayusShrestha/crop-price-prediction/blob/master/src/data_scraper.ipynb). 

## Tech Stack 
The analysis and report was made in Jupyter notebooks, using Python along with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, among others.
